Hi there! I'm currently a second year student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Petroleum and Energy Studies.

With a keen interest in machine learning and prior experience in web development, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skills. Beyond these confines, I'm also passionate about various aspects of computer science, from exploring data structures and algorithms to understanding operating systems and database management. 

Through hands-on projects and collaborative efforts, I aim to apply my knowledge and make meaningful contributions to the field. Let's embark on this journey together as we navigate the dynamic world of technology!
