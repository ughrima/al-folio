## Bloxorz Game

### Description
Bloxorz is a classic puzzle game. Players control a rectangular block, navigating it through a series of tiles with the goal of reaching the destination tile. Along the way, they must avoid falling off the edges and strategically maneuver around obstacles to progress to the next level.

### Gameplay
- Players control the movement of the block using arrow keys or swipe gestures, depending on the platform.
- The block can move horizontally or vertically but cannot be rotated.
- Tiles may have different properties, including normal tiles, movable tiles, hole tiles, and death tiles.
  - Movable tiles are the ones on which the block can move.
  - Death tiles result in instant failure if the block falls onto them.
- The game progresses through five levels, each with increasing complexity and challenges.

### How to Play
- Use the arrow keys or swipe gestures to move the block.
- Navigate the block through the level, avoiding falling off the edges or landing on death tiles.
- Reach the destination tile to complete each level.
