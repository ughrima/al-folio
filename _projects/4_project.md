## Face Recognition Attendance System

### About the Project
This project is a face recognition-based attendance system designed to detect and recognize faces in real-time using a webcam. The system marks attendance by identifying known faces from a pre-encoded dataset and records the attendance details into a CSV file.

### Features
- **Real-time Face Detection**: Utilizes a webcam to detect faces in real-time.
- **Face Recognition**: Matches detected faces with a pre-encoded dataset to recognize known individuals.
- **Attendance Marking**: Records attendance details such as name and time into a CSV file for each recognized individual.
- **Historical Data**: Saves attendance data in a daily CSV file.

### How It Works
1. **Encoding Faces**: Pre-processes and encodes faces from a dataset of images.
2. **Face Detection**: Uses the webcam to detect faces in real-time.
3. **Face Recognition**: Compares detected faces with the encoded dataset to identify known individuals.
4. **Mark Attendance**: Records the attendance by saving the name and time in a CSV file.
